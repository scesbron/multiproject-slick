Play project with subproject and play-slick
===========================================

This is a project to showcase a problem when doing tests with play-slick on a subproject

To verify the problem just do

    play test

For the UserSpec test the error is

    Configuration error[Cannot connect to database [default]] (Configuration.scala:92)

this is normal because the database does not exists

But for the CoreUserSpec test that is in the core subproject the error is

    Configuration error[Slick error : jdbc driver not defined in application.conf for db.default.driver key]

it seems that in this case play-slick cannot retrieve the configuration file
